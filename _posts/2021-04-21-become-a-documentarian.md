In 2013, Internet went crazy for astronaut Chris Hadfield, commander of International Space Station [ISS]. Just 3 years earlier, Hadfield and his family were discussing, the major budget cuts for many space programs, including Canadian Space Agency, and how to generate interest to get funding. That's when his son Evan, introduced social media to his father. So, when Hadfield went for the next 5 month mission, he took us with him. He did not just show the glamour's and sciency stuff, but he also showed day-to-day activities of an astronaut. Singing, playing music, astronaut duties, even clipping his nails, brushing teeth, plumbing, everything. 

> Wouldn't normally watch live video of a couple of guys doing plumbing repair, but IT'S IN SPACE!!!
â€” Ted. Agent of Austin Kleon. Author of the book I am reading. Show your work!

Everyone in the world loves great art and they crave even more for the process. Behind the scenes. Everyone has an urge to be a part of something. Everyone wants to know what you were thinking, when you made that decision. Just imagine, what people would give to see, what Elon Musk is up to now. Or Bill Gates, Eminem, LeBron James. And the best part is you have to give up nothing. They are all on social media, sharing their life. Now, if you want the same thing, to leave a mark, to teach someone, to learn something along with others, to build something, you just have to make a commitment to share it online. Some may say, "Well they are famous, so they can post anything and people would still love it!". It's same as saying, "Only geniuses play chess." Everyone who plays chess disagrees this and instead says, "I became a genius because of chess". Experienced! :P. 

Now how do you start? Well you just have to journal everything you want to journal. Record your work, your leisure activities, your beliefs, your interest, everything. Mix & Match the pieces and create something beautiful. That's the only way. Maybe, arrange your study table a bit different hinting at what you are doing. Or share a snap of the current book you are reading. You are on vacation, show us also the beautiful scenes you are seeing. We also wanna see. You are working on something. Show it to me. Explain it to me. Go as deep as you wanna go. People are interested. There are around 7 Billion people out there. There exists a group which would love to hear about your work and would follow you. There's a digital device in your hand right not more powerful than the computer that took Neil Armstrong to the moon. Use it! 

> Document your life, because it is worth remembering.
- Me :D
