Ever thought of being famous like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Robert Downey Jr., Bill Gates, or anyone whose famous? You don't have to be a genius to be famous, you just have to be willing to let people journey through your mind and your work and your daily routine. That's all. That's how Tesla, became such a blockbuster. That's how artists are nowadays. You are very curious to know what goes behind the scenes of that artist. Sometimes, I like someone's bloopers more than the actual content they were producing. Who doesn't! I mean bloopers are also content only.

> That's all any of us are: amateurs. We don't live long enough to be anything else.
— Charlie Chaplin

So firstly, you don't have to be a genius. Next, be an amateur — an enthusiast who pursues her work in the spirit of love (in French amateur means lover). Being an amateur is great, because everyone in this world is an amateur. Let me tell you why being an amateur is good. If you go back to your school days, you will remember that your friend was able to solve your queries more often than the professor. Why do you think that is? It is because you are friend is also an amateur and he faced the same difficulty as you, and was able to overcome it and communicate the path to you. The professor has faced that problem so far back, that he has forgotten how he solved it in the first place. 

> Find your Voice, shout it from the rooftops, and keep doing it until the people that are looking for you find you.
— Dan Harmon

Use your voice. Now, you would ask what is my voice? If you haven't already figured that out, it's simply your take on different things happening on your life. What you loved, what you didn't love. What was interesting and made you tick. What bored you. Being able to communicate that to the world is using your voice. 

From childhood, we are taught that mistakes are a bad thing and you should never make one. First of all let's check definition of mistake.

Mistake: an act or judgement that is misguided or wrong or being wrong about something

So by definition, we as children can never make mistake knowing that doing it, is a mistake. Of course, if you are doing something you have already done, and know the outcome is gonna be bad, then you are not making a mistake, you are just being bad. Mistakes can only be known after the action is taken and being reviewed, never before. 

But, because we are taught from childhood that a certain goal can only be achieved through one thing, we stop exploring the world. Imagine checkmating the opponent in chess to be achieved by following only one series of steps and never other. Imagine, if scientists never tried out new things. Mixing and matching different things. Blowing things in chemistry lab. Being an amateur, you have the freedom once again to do those things. Come to the same conclusion but with a different technique. Checkmate the opponent, starting from the same position, but taking a different route. Record your series of action, because that is what, the world will remember and it is your legacy. The legendary and extraordinary works of scientist is only preserved because they recorded them and published them for the world to see. That is their legacy. 

So, 4 things to remember. You don't have to be genius. Always think like you are an amateur. Never hesitate to try something new. Learn new things and learn them in front of others.
